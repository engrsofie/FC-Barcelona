          <h3>Final Goal Video</h3>
          <p>After 28 years of wait, Argentina finally has a trophy as it beat Brazil in the final of Copa America 2021 at the Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It is Argentina's first title since 1993 and 15th Copa America title.

            Angel Di Maria's 22nd minute strike proved enough as the Albiceleste showed great composure and determination in defence to keep the Selecao out, a feat none of the teams have achieved in this edition of the tournament.</p>
